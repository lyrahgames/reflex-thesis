\label{sec:preliminaries}

To systematically approach the topic of curve smoothing algorithms for surface meshes, basic knowledge in the topics of differential geometry for curves and its further application and generalization to polyhedral surfaces is administrable.
% It allows to rigorously generalize the concept of geodesics to discete surfaces and formulate their initial and boundary value problems.
% Geodesics can be interpreted as the class of smoothest curves and as such they build the foundation of curve smoothing algorithms.
As modern differential geometry heavily builds on the mathematical tools given in the area of analysis on manifolds, the reader is assumed to be familiar with its basic concepts.
For convenience, section~\ref{sec:analysis_on_manifolds} in the appendix provides a brief introduction to clarify and remind of notations.
% In the following, a brief overview of the main concepts is given.

\subsection{Differential Geometry of Curves} % (fold)
\label{sub:differential_geometry}

  The theory of smooth curves in space or smooth surfaces is one of the main concerns of classical differential geometry.
  Therefore, we refer to some standard textbooks, namely \textcite{goldhorn2009}, \textcite{carmo2016}, \textcite{kuehnel2013}, and \textcite{stahl2013}, for a more excessive and thorough introduction on this topic.
  For the purpose of consistent notation and as a reminder, the main concepts of smooth curves are briefly given in the following in the sense of classical and modern differential geometry based on these books.

  In the fields of analysis and numerical mathematics, it is a natural approach to extend a well-founded and -understood theory for smooth objects to their discrete counterparts and vice versa.
  Hereby, discrete or smooth objects will be typically characterized by the limit of sequences of smooth or discrete objects, respectively.
  This procedure may then allow for a generalization of properties and statements from one to the other case.
  Surface mesh curves, as they will be defined in section~\ref{sub:polyhedral_surfaces}, can exactly be seen as such discrete counterparts to the shapes of special classes of smooth parameterized curves \autocite{polthier2006}. \\

  \begin{definition}[Open and Closed Parameterized Curves]
    Let $n\in\setNatural$, $k\in\setNatural_{\infty}$, and $[a,b]\subset\setReal$ be a compact interval.\\

    An (open) ($n$-dimensional) (parameterized) curve (of class $\mathrm{C}^k$) is a $k$-times continuously differentiable function $\function{γ}{[a,b]}{\setReal^n}$ on the compact interval $[a,b]$. \\

    A closed ($n$-dimensional) (parameterized) curve (of class $\mathrm{C}^k$) is a $k$-times continuously differentiable function $\function{γ}{\mathds{T}^1[a,b]}{\setReal^n}$ on the respective one-dimensional topological torus $\mathds{T}^1[a,b]$. \\

    Parameterized curves of class $\mathrm{C}^\infty$ are also called smooth.
  \end{definition}
  In the sense of this definition, a curve needs to at least provide some kind of smoothness in the form of continuous differentiability.
  Trying only to rely on a continuity property, the definition would also include pathological cases, such as space-filling curves that cover a whole square in the plane \autocite{kuehnel2013}.
  Other generalizations therefore rely on the use of either rectifiable or piecewise continuously differentiable curves.

  Defining closed curves to be smooth functions on the topological space of a one-dimensional torus is a technicality that automatically takes care of the agreement of values and derivatives at the two boundary points which are glued together \autocite{stahl2013,carmo2016}.
  The change of topological requirements for a closed curve still allows to interpret it as a general curve.
  For this reason, when referring to parameterized curves, both closed and open curves are meant.
  To get an impression of the implications of this definition, in figure~\ref{fig:curve-examples} typical examples of smooth curves are shown.

  \end{figure}

  For most of the considered applications, the actual parameterization of a curve is not essential.
  Only the shape, given by its image, is used, referred to, and transformed.
  But using the shape and neglecting the parameterization of a curve does only make sense if the shape at least fulfills the properties of a one-dimensional manifold.
  Unfortunately, as can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:curve-examples}, the shape of parameterized curves may exhibit more general structures, such as sharp edges and self-intersections, and, thus, does not necessarily abide to these constraints.
  As a consequence, more regular and specialized classes of curves need to be looked at. \\
  \autocite{goldhorn2009,carmo2016,kuehnel2013}

  \begin{definition}[Regular and Simple Parameterized Curves]
    Let γ be a parameterized curve.
    Then γ is said to be simple if it is injective and regular if the following statement holds.
    \[
      \forall t\in \mathscr{D}(γ)^\circ \colon\quad γ'(t)\neq 0
    \]
    Furthermore, if $\norm{γ'} = 1$ then γ is parameterized by arc length.
  \end{definition}
  The definition states that the derivative of a regular curve is, apart from its boundary, never zero and therefore a map of full-rank at every inner point.
  Hence, a regular curve is an immersion into Euclidean space and, as a result, its shape is an immersed submanifold.
  Please note, an immersed submanifold still may contain self-intersections.
  Using a curve that is parameterized by arc length is a way of defining a canonical parameterization for regular curves.
  % that will be used to simplify the definition of curvature.
  It is clear by definition, that every curve parameterized by arc length is also a regular curve. \\
  \autocite{goldhorn2009,carmo2016,kuehnel2013}

  In applications that are able to handle self-intersections, regular curves are already sufficiently constrained.
  Indeed, a robust and stable algorithm for curve smoothing should be able to cope with self-intersections and even remove them if necessary.
  Still, to properly understand the transition, a regular curve shall become an embedding, such that, according to section~\ref{sec:analysis_on_manifolds}, its shape would be a one-dimensional manifold.
  To state that a curve is also simple, ensures it exhibits no self-intersections other than the single intersection for closed curves.
  The results of the ideas of this and the previous paragraph are rigorously summarized in the following proposition.
  As this statement is a direct corollary, no additional rigorous proof will be given for it.
  % Then by application of the theorem, the image of the embedding is an embedded 1-manifold.
  \autocite{goldhorn2009,carmo2016,kuehnel2013}

  \begin{corollary}[Simple, Regular Curves are Embeddings]
    Let γ be a smooth parameterized curve that is simple and regular.
    Then γ is a smooth embedding into Euclidean space and its image is an orientable and connected one-dimensional submanifold with boundary.
    If γ is closed, then its image has no boundary.
  \end{corollary}
  The fundamental part of the concept of geodesics is the curvature.
  To gain an intuitive approach to a definition of curvature of a regular curve, we need to be able to evaluate its length and arc length in Euclidean space.
  These will allow us to properly provide a canonical parameterization to simplify the use of regular curves.

  \begin{definition}[Length of Curves]
  \label{def:curve-length}
    Let γ be a parameterized curve on $[a,b]$ or $\mathds{T}^1[a,b]$.
    Then the length $L(γ)$ and arc length, given by $\function{s_γ}{[a,b]}{[0,L(γ)]}$ or $\function{s_γ}{\mathds{T}^1[a,b]}{\mathds{T}^1[0,L(γ)]}$, respectively, of γ are defined by the following expressions (see section~\ref{sec:proofs} for consistency proof).
    \[
      L(γ) \define \integral{a}{b}{\norm{γ'(t)}}{t}
      % \separate
      % \function{s_γ}{\mathscr{D}(γ)}{[0,L(γ)]}
      \separate
      s_γ(t) \define \integral{a}{t}{\norm{γ'(x)}}{x}
    \]
  \end{definition}
  The definition of the length and arc length mainly stems from a physical interpretation.
  Hereby, a parameterized curve is a trajectory of a particle moving in space with a specific velocity over time.
  In this interpretation, the particle's velocity is given by the derivative of the curve's parameterization.
  For evaluating the distance covered, one needs to integrate over the particle's speed, that is given by the magnitude of its velocity, at each point in time.

  A direct consequence for curves parameterized by arc length is that their length can be simply computed by $L(γ)=b-a$.
  This simplification leads to the idea to reparameterize general regular curves, such that they become curves parameterized by arc length and, accordingly, inheriting their good properties.
  The details for this approach are given by the following lemma for open parameterized curves with its proof provided in the appendix in section~\ref{sec:proofs}.
  % for open parameterized curves as closed curves can be seen as a special kind of open curve.
  % Its proof is given in the appendix in section~\ref{sec:proofs}.

  \begin{lemma}[Regular curves can be parameterized by arc length]
  \label{lemma:canonical-parameterization}
    Let $n\in\setNatural$, $k\in\setNatural_{\infty}$, $[a,b]\subset\setReal$ be a compact interval, and $\function{γ}{[a,b]}{\setReal^n}$ be an $n$-dimensional parameterized curve of class $\mathrm{C}^k$ that is regular.
    Then up to a constant shift, there exists a unique $k$-times continuously differentiable and bijective function $\function{u}{[c,d]}{[a,b]}$ on a compact interval $[c,d]\subset\setReal$ with strictly positive derivative, such that the composition $γ\composition u$ is a curve parameterized by arc length.
  \end{lemma}
  The proof of this lemma shows, that the inverse of the arc length of a regular curve up to some shifting can be used as a unique reparameterization to transform it into a curve parameterized by arc length.
  % In this sense, the lemma makes clear that it is sufficient to handle curves that are parameterized by arc length instead of general regular curves.
  According to this, the arc length provides a canonical parameterization.

  \begin{definition}[Canonical Parameterization by Arc Length]
    Let γ be a regular curve.
    Then its canonical parameterization by arc length $\bar{γ}$ is defined by the following expression.
    \[
      \bar{γ} \define γ\composition s_γ^{-1}
    \]
  \end{definition}
  For smooth curves parameterized by arc length, the definition of their curvature is now straight-forward, as we understand it as the amount the curve bends at a point when moving along its trajectory.
  Referring to differential calculus, the magnitude of the second derivative exactly describes this specific amount.
  \autocite{forster2016,goldhorn2009}

  \begin{definition}[Curvature of Regular Curves]
    Let $k\in\setNatural_\infty$ with $k\geq 2$, γ be a curve parameterized by arc length of class $\mathrm{C}^k$, and φ be a regular curve of class $\mathrm{C}^k$.
    Their respective curvatures $κ(γ)$ and $κ(φ)$ are defined by the following expressions.
    \[
      κ(γ)\define\norm{γ''}
      \separate
      κ(φ)\define κ(\bar{φ})\composition s_φ
    \]
  \end{definition}
  The definition involves second-order derivatives and therefore at least requires the curves to be of class $\mathrm{C}^2$.
  In differential geometry, typically only smooth curves are observed where this states no further constraints \autocite{goldhorn2009}.
  % For general regular curves, the tangent vector is not normalized which results in a scaling of the curvature value.
  % The definition omits this peculiarity by using the arc length function to get back to the original parameterization.

  To finally provide a definition for geodesics, it is no longer sufficient to look at smooth curves freely traversing the Euclidean space.
  Instead, we will embed curves into smooth surfaces which already exhibit intrinsic curvature.
  In this scenario, the overall curvature can be decomposed into the geodesic and normal curvature.

  \begin{definition}[Geodesic and Normal Curvature of Curves]
    Let $M$ be a Riemannian submanifold embedded in Euclidean space and γ be a curve embedded in $M$ and parameterized by arc length.
    The geodesic curvature $\bar{κ}_\mathrm{g}(M,γ)$ and the normal curvature $\bar{κ}_\mathrm{n}(M,γ)$ are defined as follows.
    \[
      \bar{κ}_\mathrm{g}(M,γ) \define \norm{P_{\mathrm{T}_{γ}M} (γ'')}
      \separate
      \bar{κ}_\mathrm{n}(M,γ) \define \norm{P_{\mathrm{N}_{γ}M} (γ'')}
    \]
  \end{definition}
  The geodesic curvature describes the amount a curve bends measured by an intrinsic observer of the ambient surface that is moving along the curve without any knowledge of the extrinsic curvature.
  The normal curvature on the other hand is only observable from the ambient space and depends on the extrinsic curvature and the tangential vector of the curve.
  % In the context of curve smoothing, the surfaces, we are looking at, are given by compact (orientable) Riemannian submanifolds (with boundary) of dimension two embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space.
  % Geodesic and normal curvature are simply defined by computing the norm of projecting the direction of bending into the tangential and normal space of the manifold, respectively.
  % Hence, this definition is consistent with the interpretation given above.
  As a direct consequence of the definition, the following statement can be deduced without further proof.
  \autocite{goldhorn2009,carmo2016,kuehnel2013}

  \begin{corollary}[Relationship of Geodesic and Normal Curvature]
    Let $M$ be a Riemannian submanifold embedded in Euclidean space and γ be a curve embedded in $M$  and parameterized by arc length.
    Then the following holds.
    \[
      κ^2(γ) = \bar{κ}_\mathrm{g}^2(M,γ) + \bar{κ}_\mathrm{n}^2(M,γ)
    \]
  \end{corollary}
  % This statement may also be used to generalize the normal curvature for polyhedral surfaces.
  Up to now, all curvature definitions have been non-negative scalar functions that did not provide any orientation.
  But in the context of orientable Riemannian submanifolds of dimension two, further knowledge about the direction of geodesic bending can be provided \autocite{goldhorn2009}.
  This is especially useful for implementation-specific work.
  Providing orientations for manifolds and curves allows for a more efficient moving of points along a curve or surface and access to its neighbors.

  \begin{definition}[Oriented Curvatures of Curves]
    Let $M$ be a two-dimensional oriented Riemannian submanifold embedded in $\setReal^3$ and γ be a curve embedded in $M$ and parameterized by arc length.

    Furthermore, let $\function{ν}{M}{\mathrm{N}M}$ be a differentiable field of positively oriented unit normals and $\function{μ}{M}{\mathrm{T}M}$ be a differentiable field of normalized tangent vectors such that all values of $(γ',μ\circ γ)$ are a positively oriented basis.

    The oriented geodesic and normal curvature are defined as follows, respectively.
    \[
      κ_\mathrm{g}(M,γ) = \scalarProduct{μ\circ γ}{γ''}
      \separate
      κ_\mathrm{n}(M,γ) = \scalarProduct{ν\circ γ}{γ''}
    \]
  \end{definition}
  The oriented geodesic curvature is positive when the curve bends to the left and negative when it bends to the right with respect to the chosen positive orientation of the ambient submanifold.
  The oriented normal curvature is not as important in our context as it only describes the bending of the surface along the trajectory.
  Despite this, the previous corollary still holds for these oriented formulations.

  For an intrinsic observer positioned in the ambient submanifold, the curve will be straight if it does not exhibit any geodesic curvature, because then it neither bends to the right nor to the left at any point.
  This is one of the characterizing properties of geodesics in classical and modern differential geometry and, for us, will serve as a definition and generalization \autocite{goldhorn2009,carmo2016,kuehnel2013,polthier2006}.

  \begin{definition}[Geodesic]
    Let $M$ be a Riemannian submanifold embedded in Euclidean space and γ be a curve embedded in $M$ and parameterized by arc length.
    Then γ is called a geodesic if $\bar{κ}_\mathrm{g}(M,γ) = 0$.
  \end{definition}
  The problem of finding a geodesic for a given ambient submanifold, a starting point, and a starting direction is called the geodesic initial value problem.
  In a rigorous formulation, it breaks down to a system of second-order ordinary differential equations for which it can be proven that a locally unique solution exists in some sense \autocite{polthier2006}.
  If no starting direction is given, but instead the point to end at, we call it the geodesic boundary value problem.
  The boundary value problem is not as easy to handle as the initial value problem.
  There is typically no unique solution despite the fact that there may be no solutions at all \autocite{polthier2006}.\\
  % Alas, for smoothing already given curves, the boundary value problem needs to be solved in a way that we find a single solution if there exists at least one.
  \autocite{goldhorn2009,carmo2016,kuehnel2013}

  Another important alternative characterization states that geodesics are a critical point of their length functional with respect to variations tangential to the ambient submanifold \autocite{polthier2006}.
  In general, this is understood to mean that a curve is locally shortest, that is, a slight change of the trajectory at any point will only increase the overall length of the curve.
  Unfortunately, a critical point is not necessarily a local minimum of the length of a curve and by no means a global minimum.
  Working with smooth submanifolds, this property is equivalent to our defining geodesic property.
  Embedding a curve in a polyhedral non-differentiable submanifold, the characterizing properties of geodesics are no longer equivalent \autocite{polthier2006}.
  In such a context, multiple non-trivial generalizations of geodesics are possible.

  % \begin{definition}[Geodesics Problems]
  %   Let $M$ be a two-dimensional Riemannian submanifold embedded in $\setReal^3$.

  %   The problem of finding a geodesic $\function{γ}{[a,b]}{M}$ for a given starting point $γ(a)$ and a given direction $γ'(a)$ is called the geodesic initial value problem.

  %   The problem of finding a geodesic $\function{γ}{[a,b]}{M}$ for given start and end points $γ(a)$ and $γ(b)$ is called the geodesic boundary value problem.
  % \end{definition}

\subsection{Polyhedral Surfaces and Surface Meshes} % (fold)
\label{sub:polyhedral_surfaces}

  In mathematics, smooth manifolds are well understood and provide a rich set of good properties and generalizations.
  Unfortunately, arbitrarily complex smooth manifolds are not easily representable in a computer system due to the finite amount of available storage and precision.
  In the spirit of scientific computing, surfaces of real-world objects are typically approximated by many triangles which are put together to a polyhedral surface.
  % This mesh is called a polyhedral surface or surface mesh.
  This interpretation is slightly altered in the area of computational geometry and in the context of this thesis.
  A polyhedral surface is no longer looked at as an approximation to a smooth surface but viewed as an exact description of the shape of interest.
  \autocite{sharp2020}

  Polyhedral surfaces no longer fulfill the requirements of any differentiable manifold and, at a first glance, lack many good properties.
  To cope with the implied disadvantages, they could be generalized by the rarely used concept of smooth manifolds with corners.
  Here, coordinate charts are defined over the cube space instead of the half space to directly include corners and edges (see appendix~\ref{sec:analysis_on_manifolds} definition~\ref{def:topological-manifold}).
  In the topological case, this concept is equivalent to manifolds with boundaries and does not provide further insights.
  But because the half space is only homeomorphic and not diffeomorphic to the cube space, this statement does not hold in the differential case of manifolds.
  Therefore using smooth manifolds with corners to model polyhedral surfaces could lead to a simpler handling of structures and theorems.
  Unfortunately, according to \textcite{joyce2009}, the exact definition of manifolds with corners is not universally agreed upon and still raises questions and problems.
  Therefore, in this thesis, the focus will put on the definition and ideas given by \textcite{polthier2006}.
  \autocite{joyce2009}

  \begin{definition}[Triangle]
    Let $n\in\setNatural$ with $n\geq 2$ and $A,B,C\in\setReal^n$ affinely independent points.
    Then the (topological) triangle $\triangle$ (embedded in $\setReal^n$) is given by the following expression.
    \[
      \triangle \define \set{uA + vB + wC}{u,v,w\in[0,1], u+v+w=1}
    \]
    The triangle's vertices $\mathscr{V}(\triangle)$ and edges $\mathscr{E}(\triangle)$ are hereby defined as follows.
    \[
      \mathscr{V}(\triangle) \define \set{A,B,C}{}
      \separate
      \mathscr{E}(\triangle) \define \set{\overline{AB}, \overline{BC}, \overline{CA}}{}
    \]
  \end{definition}
  The triangle is defined in the topological context by using barycentric coordinates.
  Its structure on the other hand is given by its vertices and edges.
  To show some basic manifold properties, I first introduce a restricted parameter set.
  \[
    D \define \set{(u,v) \in [0,1]^2}{u + v < 1}
  \]
  Furthermore, the set $Π(\triangle)$ of all vertex arrangements is needed to also handle orientation.
  \[
    Π(\triangle) \define \set{\function{π}{\set{1,2,3}{}}{\mathscr{V}(\triangle)}}{\text{π bijective}}
  \]
  Then let $π\in Π(\triangle)$ be arbitrary and define the following coordinate charts and atlases.
  \[
    \function{φ_π}{\overline{D}}{\triangle}
    \separate
    φ_π(u,v) \define (1 - u - v) π_1 + u π_2 + v π_3
  \]
  \[
    \mathscr{A} \define \set{\roundBrackets{φ_π(D),φ_π|_D^{-1}}}{π\in Π(\triangle)}
    \separate
    \mathscr{A}^\circ \define \set{\roundBrackets{\triangle^\circ, φ_π|_{D^\circ}^{-1}}}{π\in Π(\triangle)}
  \]
  Given $\mathscr{A}$ as atlas for $\triangle$, it follows directly that $\triangle$ is an orientable topological 2-manifold with boundary embedded in $\setReal^n$.
  Using $\mathscr{A}^\circ$ as atlas for $\triangle^\circ$, the open triangle an orientable smooth 2-manifold without boundary.
  For orientability, let the following equivalence relation define when two vertex arrangements $π,π'\in Π(\triangle)$ induce the same orientation.
  \[
    π\sim π' \quad :\iff \quad \exists σ\in\mathrm{S}_3, \mathrm{sgn}\, σ = 1 \colon\quad π' = π\circ σ
  \]
  The quotient space of vertex arrangements then only consist of two elements which uniquely model the possible orientations of a triangle that are schematically visualized in figure~\ref{fig:triangle-orientations}.
  \[
    Π(\triangle)/\sim = \set{[π], [\bar{π}]}{}
  \]

  \begin{definition}[Oriented Triangle]
    An oriented triangle $\triangle_{[π]} \define (\triangle, [π])$ is tuple consisting of a triangle $\triangle$ and a chosen orientation $[π]\in Π(\triangle)/\sim$ of that triangle.
    The set of directed edges is then given by the following.
    % Let $\triangle$ be a triangle and $[π]\in Π(\triangle)/\sim$ be an orientation of $\triangle$.
    % The oriented
    % \[
    %   \triangle_{[π]} \define (\triangle, [π])
    % \]
    \[
      \mathscr{E}(\triangle_{[π]}) \define \set{\overrightarrow{π_1π_2},\overrightarrow{π_2π_3}, \overrightarrow{π_3π_1}}{}
    \]
    % \[
    %   ϑ_\triangle(A) = \arccos\frac{\scalarProduct{\overrightarrow{AB}}{\overrightarrow{AC}}}{\norm{\overrightarrow{AB}}\norm{\overrightarrow{AC}}}
    % \]
  \end{definition}
  Triangles are planar surfaces and, hence, geodesics are given by straight lines.
  Furthermore, the triangle is by definition a convex set and therefore always provides a unique solution for the geodesic boundary value problem.

  \begin{definition}[Polyhedral Surface and Surface Mesh]
    Let $n\in\setNatural$ with $n\geq 2$ and $\mathscr{T}\neq\emptyset$ be a finite set of triangles embedded in $\setReal^n$.
    Let $S=\bigcup\mathscr{T}$ be a two-dimensional topological manifold (with boundary), such that for all $\triangle_1,\triangle_2\in\mathscr{T}$ with $\triangle_1\neq\triangle_2$ the following holds.
    \[
      \triangle_1\cap\triangle_2 \in \set{\emptyset}{} \cup [\mathscr{V}(\triangle_1)\cap\mathscr{V}(\triangle_2)] \cup [\mathscr{E}(\triangle_1)\cap\mathscr{E}(\triangle_2)]
    \]
    In this case, $S$ is called a (topological) polyhedral surface (embedded in $\setReal^n$).
    With $\mathscr{V}(S)$ we denote its vertices, with $\mathscr{E}(S)$ its edges, and with $\mathscr{F}(S)$ its faces.
    \[
      \mathscr{V}(S) \define \bigcup_{\triangle\in\mathscr{T}} \mathscr{V}(\triangle)
      \separate
      \mathscr{E}(S) \define \bigcup_{\triangle\in\mathscr{T}} \mathscr{E}(\triangle)
      \separate
      \mathscr{F}(S) \define \mathscr{T}
    \]
    (topological) surface mesh.
    \[
      \mathscr{M}(S) \define \textstyle\bigcup \mathscr{E}(S)
    \]
    \[
      \partial\mathscr{E}(S) \define \set{e\in\mathscr{E}(S)}{\exists!\triangle\in\mathscr{F}(S)\colon e\subset\triangle}
      \separate
      \mathscr{E}^\circ(S) \define \mathscr{E}(S) \setminus \partial\mathscr{E}(S)
    \]
    \[
      \partial S \define \textstyle\bigcup \partial\mathscr{E}(S)
      \separate
      \partial\mathscr{V}(S) \define \mathscr{V}(S) \cap \partial S
      \separate
      \mathscr{V}^\circ(S) \define \mathscr{V}(S) \setminus \partial\mathscr{V}(S)
    \]
  \end{definition}
  A surface mesh is again a topological 2-manifold.

  \begin{definition}[Oriented Surface Mesh]
    Let $S$ be a surface mesh and $\function{Π}{\mathscr{F}(S)}{\bigsqcup_{\triangle\in\mathscr{F}(S)} Π_\triangle}$.
    \[
      \forall \triangle_1,\triangle_2\in\mathscr{F}(S),\triangle_1\neq\triangle_2\colon\quad \mathscr{E}(Π(\triangle_1)) \cap \mathscr{E}(Π(\triangle_2)) = \emptyset
    \]
    $(S,Π)$ is called an oriented surface mesh.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{definition}[Discrete Surface Mesh Curve]
    Let $n\in\setNatural$, $S$ be a surface mesh, and $x\in \boxBrackets{\bigcup\mathscr{E}(S)}^{n+1}$ be a tuple of $n+1$ points on the edges of the surface mesh $S$, such that adjacent points lie on the same triangle.
    \[
      \forall k\in\setNatural,k\leq n\colon x_k\neq x_{k+1} \land \exists \triangle\in\mathscr{F}(S)\colon x_k, x_{k+1}\in\triangle
    \]
    The (topological) curve given by connecting adjacent points by a straight line is called the (topological) discrete surface mesh curve.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{definition}[Surface Mesh Curve without Artifacts]
    Let $S$ be a polyhedral surface and γ be a surface mesh curve characterized by $x\in\mathscr{M}^{n+1}(S)$.
    \[
      \forall k\in\setNatural, 1\leq k \leq n\colon
      \mathscr{F}_S(x_{k-1}) \cap \mathscr{F}_S(x_{k+1}) = \emptyset
    \]
    If γ is a closed curve, that is $x_0 = x_{n+1}$, then
    \[
      \mathscr{F}_S(x_1) \cap \mathscr{F}_S(x_n) = \emptyset
    \]
  \end{definition}

  Surface mesh curves without artifacts will never contain points that lie on the inside of a boundary edge.
  They may contain boundary vertices.

  \begin{definition}[Total Vertex Angle]
    \[
      ϑ_S(v) \define \sum_{\triangle\in\mathscr{T}, v\in\triangle} ϑ_\triangle(v)
    \]
  \end{definition}

  \begin{definition}[Curve Angle]
    Let $S$ be a polyhedral surface and $p,x,q\in\mathscr{M}(S)$, $x\in S^\circ$ be adjacent vertices of surface mesh curve without artifacts on $S$.
    Let $\mathscr{V}_S(x)$ the neighboring vertices.
    The neighbor set can be partitioned into three possible empty tuples, such that $p,(x),q$ is surface mesh curvature without artifacts.
    There exists two tuples $(p=x_{λ(0)},x_{λ(1)},\ldots,x_{λ(n)},x_{λ(n+1)} = q)$ and $(p,x_{ρ(1)},\ldots,x_{ρ(m)},q)$ that characterize a surface mesh curve without artifacts.
    \[
      β_λ = \sum_{k=1}^n \sphericalangle(x_{λ(k-1)},x_{λ(k)},x_{λ(k+1)})
      \separate
      β_ρ = \sum_{k=1}^m \sphericalangle(x_{ρ(k-1)},x_{ρ(k)},x_{ρ(k+1)})
    \]
    The (unoriented) curve angle at $x$ is given by the sum
    \[
      β = \min \set{β_λ, β_ρ}{}
    \]
    If there is an orientation $Π$ for $S$ then the (oriented) curve angle is given by the segmentation which points are connected by directed edge paths in their respective triangles such that $x$ is not contained.
  \end{definition}
  For the oriented case, the curve angle can only be defined for curve vertices that do not lie on the boundary of $S$.
  Also the interpretation of the total vertex angle for boundary points is different.
  This makes a generalization of the oriented discrete curvature at boundary points difficult.

  \begin{definition}[Discrete Geodesic Curvature]
    \[
      κ_\mathrm{g}(γ) = π - \frac{2π}{ϑ_S(γ)}β_S(γ)
    \]
